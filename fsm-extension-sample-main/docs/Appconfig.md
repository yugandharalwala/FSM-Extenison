# Appconfig.json file

When creating the extension application and installing it manually on an arbitrary platform, there must be an endpoint `/appconfig.json` under the extension application root URL.

The `appconfig.json` file contains metadata about the extension application. The structure of the `appconfig.json` file must follow the definition as [documented here](https://help.sap.com/viewer/fsm_extensions/Cloud/en-US/appconfig.html).
